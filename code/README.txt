The three 'main' scripts were used for the main workflow, making use of the functions in the 'funcs' scripts.
The script 'transfer_annotations.py' was used to transfer annotations from SARS-CoV-2 to the MSA, resulting in the input file for the gene breakpoint set.
The script 'analyse_results.py' was used to gather information on constructed trees and networks, which was processed further to display the results (spreadsheets, tables etc.)
