MSA files
  -- Corona_original_all.mafft.nex is an MSA with 300 genomes including annotation of deleted regions from Grimm and Morrison
  -- Corona.ph.epf is the MSA with 21 genomes from Grimm and Morrison
  -- Corona_edited.ph.epf is my edited version of the MSA with 21 genomes (where the location of a gap in the start codon of ORF3a was changed from A-TG to -ATG for a few taxa)
  -- Corona_edited.ph.epf.nex is the same but then in NEXUS format

Other
  -- Corona_distance_matrix.xlsx from Grimm and Morrison has distance matrix used to decide on taxon selections
  -- MSA_annotation_deleted_regions.txt (extracted from Corona_original_all.mafft.nex) was used to transfer annotations from SARS-CoV-2 (gene_annotations_all_sarscov2.txt) to the MSA (gene_annotations_all_MSA.txt)
  -- taxon_selections folder contains text files with sequences that were excluded for each taxon selection
